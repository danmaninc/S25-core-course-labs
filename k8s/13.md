# ArgoCD for GitOps Deployment

## Task 1: Deploy and Configure ArgoCD

### 1. Install ArgoCD via Helm

I have added ArgoCD Helm repository, installed ArgoCD and verified installation. It was successful.

![Step 1, point 3: successfully verified installation](./img/lab13/lab13_task1_3.png)

### 2. Install ArgoCD CLI

I have installed the ArgoCD CLI tool and verified its installation.

### 4. Configure Python App Sync

I have created an ArgoCD folder and defined the ArgoCD application.

After that, I applied the configuration and verified sync:

![Step 4, point 4.2: successfully got status](./img/lab13/lab13_task1_9.png)

### 5. Test Sync Workflow

I modified the `values.yaml` (changed the `replicaCount` from 1 to 3).
Then, I committed and pushed these changes to the target branch from the config (in my case, it is `feature/lab13`).
The commit hash is [f5cf33d](https://github.com/danmaninc/S25-core-course-labs/commit/f5cf33d94abd3fe2a03355ed5f20e3a8d08de46c).

![Step 5, point 1 and 2: successfully modified the values.yaml and pushed change to the repository](./img/lab13/lab13_task1_10.png)

Then I observed that ArgoCD auto-synced the update. You can notice, that `deployment.apps/python-app-app-python configured`, which means that ArgoCD auto-synced the update successfully.

![Step 5, point 3: successfully auto-synced the update](./img/lab13/lab13_task1_11.png)

Also, we can notice that the number of pods indeed was increased.

Therefore, the Task 1 was completed successfully.
