## Yandex Cloud Infrastructure

1. I have created an account on [Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/)
2. There is one available free-tier option: a grant for 1000â‚½ that may be spent for virtual machines, which are suitable for this lab.
   > During the whole process of building a Yandex Cloud Infrastructure, I have followed the official [Yandex Quickstart Guide](https://yandex.cloud/en-ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart#linux_1).
3. To begin the setup, we need to create a [service account](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/concepts/users/service-accounts) via Identity and Access Management.

- I have chosen the folder where I wanted to create a service account. In my particular case, it was a `default` folder.
- Then I clicked the **Identity and Access Management** service in the service list
- Then I clicked the **Create service account** button.
- In the modal I specified the desired name, description, and have chosen the `editor` role and created the account.
  > **CAVEAT:** do not forget to set roles for a service account! Service account requires at least an `editor` role to have possibility to create a resources inside our folder.

4. Then we need to create [an authorized key](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/key) for the brand new service account.

The command I entered is:

```powershell
yc iam key create \
  --service-account-id aje***************** \
  --folder-name default \
  --output key.json
```

where:

- `service-account-id` is an identifier of service account
- `folder-name` is the name of folder where the service account is created. In my case it is `default`
- `output` is the name of output file, which will contain this authorized key.

The output:

```powershell
id: aje*****************
service_account_id: aje*****************
created_at: "2025-06-02T10:57:43.479156798Z"
key_algorithm: RSA_2048
```

5. Then I have created the CLI profile to perform operations as a service account.

```powershell
yc config profile create terraform_cli
```

The output:

```powershell
Profile 'terraform_cli' created and activated
```

6. Also we need to set the profile configuration.

To do so, I used the following commands:

```powershell
yc config set service-account-key key.json
yc config set cloud-id b1g*****************
yc config set folder-id b1g*****************
```

where:

- `service-account-key` is a file with authorized key of service account
- `cloud-id` is the identifier of a cloud
- `folder-id` is the identifier of a folder (in my case `default`)

7. Then I have added the authentication data from the previous step to the environment variables.
   Since I am using Windows as my primary OS, I did it in Powershell:

```powershell
$Env:YC_TOKEN=$(yc iam create-token)
$Env:YC_CLOUD_ID=$(yc config get cloud-id)
$Env:YC_FOLDER_ID=$(yc config get folder-id)
```

where:

- `YC_TOKEN` is IAM-token.
- `YC_CLOUD_ID` is the identifier of a cloud
- `YC_FOLDER_ID` is the identifier of a folder

8. Then we need to configure the Terraform provider.
   If you have previous provider (I did not have one), then you need to save its preferences.

```powershell
mv $env:APPDATA/terraform.rc $env:APPDATA/terraform.rc.old
```

I created the file `terraform.rc` and added the following block (which specifying the official Terraform mirror).

```powershell
provider_installation {
  network_mirror {
    url = "https://terraform-mirror.yandexcloud.net/"
    include = ["registry.terraform.io/*/*"]
  }
  direct {
    exclude = ["registry.terraform.io/*/*"]
  }
}
```

9. Then I generated the SSH key for the user:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yc"
```

10. Now we can setup the Terraform configuration file.
    I have used the template specified in the guide, but it may be changed according to our needs.

- the provider is Yandex Cloud
- the availability zone of the provider is `ru-central1-a`

The image list is provided by Yandex Cloud Marketplace, which is available by this command:

```powershell
yc compute image list --folder-id standard-images
```

I have decided to use common LTS image - `ubuntu-2204-lts`, which has this ID: `fd85u0rct32prepgjlv0`.

### Resources created

The YC Disk is connected to YC Instance.
The YC Instance is connected to YVPC Subnet.
The YVPC Subnet is connected to YVPC Network.

The created VM has two IP addresses: internal and external.

- Yandex Compute Disk (HDD, 20GB, `ru-central1-a`, `ubuntu-2204-lts` image)
- Yandex Compute Instance (CPUx2, 2GB RAM)
- Yandex VPC Network
- Yandex VPC Subnet (`ru-central1-a`)

> Additionally, for the VM it is necessary to setup the **user metadata** (in the resource config I specified the metadata field and provided path to the `user_metadata.txt` file). It contains the public SSH key generated earlier and username for the user on this VM.

10. Then I initiated the provider using `terraform init`.

11. Format and validate the Terraform configuration: `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`.

12. Then let's perform the check: `terraform plan`.

Output:

```powershell
> terraform plan
